            Chapter 1
            Introduction
            OUTLINE
            ➢Ethics and Computer ethics
            ➢Ethical Issues
            ➢New technologies ethics
            ETHICS
            Ethics is “The standards that
            determine whether an action is
            good or bad”
            ETHICS
            Ethics is the field of study in
            philosophy that is concerned with
            judgments about what human
            behavior is "good" or "bad" in any
            given situation.
            ETHICS
            Why we need to study Ethics?
            Some Chooses are clear
            Most of us know that killing, stealing, lying, and 
            cheating are wrong
            These actions are commonsense ethics.
            Others are Not
            Some ethical choices are harder when the situation 
            is not as clear
            Lying may be wrong but if you visit a sick friend is it 
            wrong to exaggerate how well they look?
            Is it wrong to steal food is one is starving?
            EXAMPLE
            The ATM Machine
            ✓Can find it anytime
            ✓Can find it anywhere
            ✓Fast
            ✓Cheap
            Also,
            ✓Impact on employment
            ✓unfriendliness and customer service
            ✓Crime
            ✓ Privacy
            ✓ Errors and dependability
            ✓So, are ATM’s a good or a bad
            ETHICS
            What is ethical? Sociologist replies the
            base of ethics are:
            1) Ethics has to do with what my feelings
            tell me is right or wrong.
            2) Ethics has to do with my religious
            beliefs.
            3) Being ethical is doing what the law
            requires.
            4) Ethics consists of the standards of
            behavior our society accepts
            COMPUTER ETHICS 
            Computer ethics is a field of
            study that deals with the ethical
            issues and problems that arise
            from the use of computers and
            related technology.
            COMPUTER ETHICS 
            Computer Ethics involves examining
            the ethical implications of various
            technologies and practices, and
            determining how individuals and
            organizations should behave in the
            digital world.
            OUTLINE
            ➢Ethics and Computer ethics
            ➢Ethical Issues
            ➢New technologies ethics
            ETHICAL ISSUES
            Ethical issues in Information Technology is
            a situation where a ethical problem arises
            and must be addressed.
            Ethical issues occur when a given decision,
            scenario or activity creates a conflict with
            a society’s (religion) moral principles.
            Examples of computer ethical issues are:
            ETHICAL ISSUES : PRIVACY
            1) Privacy: Ensuring that personal data is
            kept private and secure, and not shared
            without permission.
            Example: In 2020, the popular video game
            "Animal Crossing: New Horizons" was
            found to be collecting data on players' ingame activities and sharing it with third
            parties for targeted advertising purposes.
            ETHICAL ISSUES : SECURITY
            2. Security: Protecting computer systems
            and networks from unauthorized access or
            attacks.
            Example: In 2017, the credit reporting
            company Equifax announced that it had
            suffered a data crack in which the personal
            data of 143 million individuals, including
            social security numbers and financial
            information, was accessed by hackers.
            ETHICAL ISSUES : SECURITY
            أكدت دار اإلفتاء أن اختراق شبكات -الواي فاي،- يعني: أن
            ّي الشخص يقوم من خالل بعض البرامج باكتشاف الرقم ،
            السر
            الذي من شأنه أن يمنع اآلخرين من االنتفاع بهذه الشبكة ذات
            القدر المعلوم والذي دفع صاحبه ثمنه لينتفع به، وقد وضع له

            والحاكم(.
            ETHICAL ISSUES : PROPERTY
            3) Property: Respecting the intellectual property
            of others, including software, Websites,
            Multimedia and other digital content.
            Example: In 2020, the popular video sharing
            platform, TikTok, was sued by the music
            publishing company, Artists Rights Alliance
            (ARA), for purportedly failing to obtain the
            necessary licenses for the use of songs in usergenerated videos. The ARA claimed that TikTok
            had not obtained licenses for millions of songs,
            and required damages of $150,000 per song.
            ETHICAL ISSUES : CYBERCRIME
            4. Cybercrime: Opposing the use of technology to
            commit crimes, such as identity theft, Credit Card
            fraud, ransomware attacks , Cyberterrorist and
            other forms of cybercrime.
            Example: In 2017, the WannaCry ransomware
            attack affected over 200,000 computers in 150
            countries. The attack exploited a vulnerability in
            the Windows operating system and encrypted the
            victims' files, demanding a payment in exchange
            for the decryption key.
            Files encrypted with .dewd extension
            ETHICAL ISSUES : CYBERCRIME
            ETHICAL ISSUES : SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
            5) Social responsibility: Recognizing the impact
            that technology has on society and working to
            promote the common good.
            Example: workers already have been replaced by
            computerized devices -- bank tellers, auto
            workers, telephone operators, typists, graphic
            artists, security guards, assembly-line workers,
            and on and on.
            ETHICAL ISSUES : SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
            Another example: Freedom of Expression
            ▪Freedom of expression and computer ethics are
            closely related because technology has greatly
            expanded the ways in which people can express
            themselves, but it also raises ethical concerns that
            need to be considered.
            ▪These technologies have made it easier for
            individuals to access and share information, and have
            created new forums for expression, such as social
            media platforms.
            ▪Also, it is very easy to be anonymous. If people don't
            know who you really are, then it is very difficult for
            anyone to find you.
            ETHICAL ISSUES : NETIQUETTE
            6) Netiquette is short for "Internet
            etiquette." Just like etiquette is a code of
            polite behavior in society, netiquette is a
            code of good behavior on the Internet.
            This includes several aspects of the
            Internet, such as email, social media,
            online chat, web forums, website
            comments, multiplayer gaming, and other
            types of online communication.
            ETHICAL ISSUES : NETIQUETTE
            Examples:
            1) Don’t SHOUT – Avoid writing whole words or
            sentences in capital letters. This is the equivalent of
            someone SCREAMING IN YOUR EAR.
            2) Respect others' privacy: Do not share someone's
            personal information without their permission.
            3) Respect others' opinions: While it is okay to disagree
            with someone, it is important to do so in a respectful
            manner.
            ETHICAL ISSUES : NETIQUETTE
            4) Use a clear and concise subject line in emails: This
            will help the recipient understand the purpose of the email
            and whether they need to read it immediately.
            5) Be patient: Remember that not everyone responds to
            emails or messages immediately, so try to be patient when
            waiting for a reply.
            6) Be mindful of cultural differences: Remember that
            not everyone has the same cultural background or
            experiences as you, so try to be respectful of these
            differences when communicating online.
            ETHICAL ISSUES : NETIQUETTE
            ETHICAL ISSUES: DIGITAL DIVIDE 
            7) Digital Divide refers to the gap between
            individuals, households, businesses, and
            geographic areas that have access to modern
            information and communication technologies
            (ICTs), and those that do not.
            For example, those who do not have access to the
            internet may not be able to take advantage of
            online education programs or apply for jobs that
            require online applications. In addition, the
            digital divide can contribute to social and
            economic inequality, as those with access to ICTs
            may have an advantage over those without.
            ETHICAL ISSUES: DIGITAL DIVIDE 
            Example: In a rural community in the United States,
            many households do not have access to high-speed
            internet service.
            To address this issue, a local nonprofit organization
            partners with the community to provide free internet
            access at a community center and local library. In
            addition, the organization provides training and support to
            help individuals learn how to use the internet and take
            advantage of online resources. This helps to bridge the
            digital divide in the community and provide equal access
            to information and opportunities for all.
            ETHICAL ISSUES: DIGITAL DIVIDE 
            ETHICAL ISSUES : GREEN COMPUTING 
            8) Green computing is the practice of using
            computing resources efficiently.
            The goal of green computing is to reduce the
            environmental impact of computing and to
            ensure that technology is used in a way that is
            sustainable and does not reduce natural
            resources. This includes reducing the amount
            of energy used by computer systems, using
            materials that are easier to recycle or reuse, and
            disposing of electronic devices in an
            environmentally responsible manner.
            ETHICAL ISSUES : GREEN COMPUTING 
            ▪Example: A large corporation is
            looking to reduce its environmental
            impact and save money on energy
            costs. The corporation replaces their
            old, energy-inefficient computers with
            newer models that are Energy Star
            certified and use less energy. They
            also set up a system for properly
            disposing of e-waste, including
            recycling and donating usable
            equipment.
            ETHICAL ISSUES : GREEN COMPUTING 
            Some countries have implemented laws and
            regulations to encourage the proper disposal of ewaste.
            For example, in the European Union, producers
            of electronic equipment are required to take back
            and recycle their products at the end of their
            lifespan.
            ETHICAL ISSUES : GREEN COMPUTING 
            ETHICAL ISSUES : COMPUTER ADDICTION
            9) Computer addiction, also known as internet
            addiction or gaming addiction, refers to the
            excessive use of computers or other digital devices
            to the point where it interferes with an individual's
            daily life and relationships.
            Computer addiction can have negative impacts on an
            individual's physical and mental health, as well as on
            their relationships and social life. It is important for
            individuals to be aware of their computer use and to
            seek help if they feel that their use is becoming
            excessive or problematic
            ETHICAL ISSUES : COMPUTER ADDICTION
            Example: A college student becomes increasingly
            dependent on their computer for communication and
            entertainment. He spend long hours on social media,
            playing video games, and watching videos online. He
            begin to neglect their schoolwork, relationships, and
            other responsibilities, and their grades suffer as a result.
            Eventually, the student realizes that their addiction to the
            computer is causing problems in his life, and he seek
            help. He received treatment for his addiction, including
            therapy and support from a recovery group. With time
            and effort, he is able to break their dependency on the
            computer and regain control of their life.
            ETHICAL ISSUES : COMPUTER ADDICTION
            OUTLINE
            ➢Ethics and Computer ethics
            ➢Ethical Issues
            ➢New technologies ethics
            NEW TECHNOLOGIES ETHICS
            ▪ New technologies give us more power to act, which
            means that we have to make choices we didn't have
            to make before.
            ▪In the past few decades many new ethical questions
            have appeared because of innovations in medical,
            communications, and weapons technologies.
            ▪Now, Information technology ethics raises new and
            unique moral problems because information
            technology itself has brought about dramatic social,
            political, and economic change.
            NEW TECHNOLOGIES ETHICS: AI
            Examples of ethics arises in new information technology
            are:
            1) Artificial Intelligence:
            The ethics of artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the moral
            issues and problems that arise from the development and
            use of AI.
            Some of the ethical issues surrounding AI include:
            NEW TECHNOLOGIES ETHICS: AI
            a) Bias: AI systems can maintain and amplify
            existing biases, leading to unfair outcomes for
            certain groups of people.
            For example: In 2018, the US technology
            company, Amazon, faced criticism for its AIpowered hiring tool, which was found to be biased
            against women. The tool, which was designed to
            review job applicants' resumes, was found to be
            twice as likely to recommend men for job
            openings as women.
            NEW TECHNOLOGIES ETHICS: AI
            b) Responsibility: It is often unclear who is
            responsible for the actions of AI systems, and how
            to hold them accountable for any negative
            consequences.
            Example: In 2021, the US technology company,
            Apple, faced criticism for its involvement in the
            development of an AI-powered facial recognition
            tool that was used by the Chinese government to
            track and monitor the Uighur minority group.
            NEW TECHNOLOGIES ETHICS: AI
            c) Privacy: The use of AI may raise concerns
            about the collection and use of personal data, and
            may impact an individual's privacy and control
            over their personal information.
            Example: AI-driven consumer products and
            independent systems are frequently equipped with
            sensors that generate and collect vast amounts of
            data without the knowledge or consent of those in
            their proximity.
            NEW TECHNOLOGIES ETHICS: AI
            d) Unemployment: The development and use of
            AI may lead to the displacement of certain jobs,
            raising concerns about the impact on employment
            and the economy.
            Example: In its recent Future of Jobs Report, the
            World Economic Forum estimated that AI will
            replace some 85 million jobs by 2025.
            NEW TECHNOLOGIES ETHICS: 
            SOCIAL MEDIA
            2) Social Media: The widespread use of
            social media has raised ethical concerns about
            the impact on individuals' privacy, the spread
            of misinformation, and the potential for
            negative impacts on mental health.
            Example: In 2018, the personal data of
            millions of Facebook users was improperly
            accessed and shared with political consulting
            firm Cambridge Analytica, without the users'
            knowledge or consent.
            NEW TECHNOLOGIES ETHICS: 
            SOCIAL MEDIA
            Example: In 2020, the US presidential election
            was marked by widespread misinformation on
            social media platforms, including false or
            misleading information about candidates, voting
            procedures, and election results.
            NEW TECHNOLOGIES ETHICS: 
            SOCIAL MEDIA
            Example: In 2020, a study published in the
            journal "Clinical Psychological Science" found
            that social media use was associated with
            increased risk of depression, nervousness, and
            other mental health problems in young adults.
            The study found that the more time young adults

            3) Robotics:
            The ethics of robotics refers to the moral issues and
            problems that arise from the development and use of
            robots. Some of the ethical issues surrounding
            robotics include:
            1.Bias: Robots can spread and amplify existing biases,
            leading to unfair outcomes for certain groups of
            people.
            2.Responsibility: It is often unclear who is responsible
            for the actions of robots, and how to hold them
            accountable for any negative consequences.

            ROBOTICS 
            3. Privacy: The use of robots may raise concerns
            about the collection and use of personal data, and
            may impact an individual's privacy and control
            over their personal information.
            4. Unemployment: The development and use of
            robots may lead to the displacement of certain
            jobs, raising concerns about the impact on
            employment and the economy.

            ROBOTICS 
            5. Autonomy: Robots may be capable of making
            decisions on their own, raising questions about
            the limits of their autonomy and the role of
            humans in decision-making.
            Example: Autonomous Weapons Systems are
            defined by the U.S. Department of Defense as “a
            weapon system(s) that, once activated, can select
            and engage targets without further intervention
            by a human operator.

            MULTIMEDIA TECHNOLOGY 
            4) Multimedia Technology: Multimedia can be
            created using a variety of techniques and tools,
            such as image editing software, video editing
            software, and audio editing software.
            Fake multimedia refers to digitally altered or
            fabricated images, videos, or audio recordings that
            are designed to mislead or cheat.
            It can be difficult to detect, especially if it has
            been well-crafted, and this can make it a powerful
            tool for spreading misinformation or propaganda.
            ETHICAL ISSUES : NEW TECHNOLOGIES 
            ETHICS MULTIMEDIA TECHNOLOGY 
            Example: During a political campaign, a group of
            supporters of a candidate creates a fake video
            that appears to show their opponent making
            controversial statements. They disseminate the
            video on social media and through other
            channels, hoping to damage the opponent's
            reputation and swing public opinion in their
            favor.

            VIRTUAL REALITY 
            5) Virtual Reality: The ethics of virtual reality
            pertain to the moral considerations surrounding
            the use and development of VR technology.
            Example: is the potential for VR to be used as a
            means of escapism (escape from reality) ,
            causing users to withdraw from the real world
            and neglect their responsibilities.
            This could be a problem if people become so
            attached to this virtual reality that they neglect
            real-life relationships in the physical world.
            NEW TECHNOLOGIES ETHICS: 
            VIRTUAL REALITY 
            Also, the use of VR in training military, law
            enforcement and other personnel can raise ethical
            concerns.
            For example, there may be a risk that personnel
            who are trained using VR simulations will be less
            effective in real-world situations.
            NEW TECHNOLOGIES ETHICS: 
            VIRTUAL REALITY 
            Another example, a normal computer
            game may be violent, but it is violence
            shown through a screen, involving tiny
            characters. In VR you are part of the
            scenario, everything happening is around
            you, the characters are life-sized, they can
            look you in the eye. This is a qualitatively
            different type of experience compared to
            video games or movies."

            MOBILE APPLICATIONS
            6) Mobile Applications: Mobile Applications most
            commonly referred to as an app, is a type of
            application software designed to run on a mobile
            device, such as a smartphone or tablet computer.
            Few devices know more personal details about
            people than the smartphones in their pockets: phone
            numbers, current location, often the owner’s real
            name—even a unique ID number that can never be
            changed or turned off. photos and videos, also to
            monitor our heart rate, start the car remotely on a
            dark night, find a nearby restaurant, and pay for
            purchases on-the-spot.
            NEW TECHNOLOGIES ETHICS: 
            MOBILE APPLICATIONS
            Example: In 2020, the US tech company, Google,
            faced criticism for its development of a mobile
            application called "Location History." The app
            collected users' location data and used it to
            personalize the content of ads. Some critics
            argued that the app raised concerns about privacy,
            as it collected users' location data without their
            explicit consent and used it for targeted
            advertising.

            CLOUD COMPUTING
            7) Cloud computing: It is a type of computing in
            which resources, including software and data, are
            stored on remote servers and accessed via the
            internet. This allows users to access and use these
            resources from anywhere, as long as they have an
            internet connection.
            Cloud computing ethics refers to the moral issues and
            problems that arise from the use of cloud computing
            services. Some of the ethical issues surrounding
            cloud computing include: Privacy and Security.

            CLOUD COMPUTING
            Example: In 2021, the use of cloud computing
            services by the healthcare industry raised ethical
            concerns. As more healthcare providers and
            organizations were storing and processing
            sensitive personal information and medical data
            in the cloud, concerns about data privacy and
            security were raised. There were examples of
            healthcare providers losing control of patient
            data, or suffering data breaks due to lack of
            security measures.
            NEW TECHNOLOGIES ETHICS: 3D 
            PRINTERS
            8- 3D printer: is a type of machine that creates threedimensional objects by building them up layer by layer.
            The process begins with a digital model of the object to
            be printed, which is then divided into thin layers that are
            used to guide the printer as it builds up the object.
            The ethics of 3D printing ethics refer to the moral issues
            and problems that arise from the use of 3D printing
            technology. Some of the ethical issues surrounding 3D
            printing include Intellectual property, which is called
            forgery.

            PRINTERS
            NEW TECHNOLOGIES ETHICS: 3D 
            PRINTERS
            3D printing makes it easy to reproduce objects (forgery),
            raising concerns about the unauthorized reproduction of
            copyrighted works, such as sculptures, jewelry, and other
            artistic works
            Example: In 2018, a company called Shapeways, which
            operates a 3D printing marketplace, was sued for
            copyright infringement by a jewelry designer. The
            designer claimed that Shapeways had allowed users to
            upload and sell copies of her copyrighted designs without
            her permission.
            NEW TECHNOLOGIES ETHICS: 
            CRYPTOCURRENCY
            9) Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that uses
            cryptography for security and operates independently of a
            central bank. Cryptocurrency uses decentralized
            technology, such as blockchain, to facilitate secure and
            transparent transactions.
            The most well-known cryptocurrency is Bitcoin, but there
            are many other types of cryptocurrencies, such as
            Ethereum, Litecoin, and Ripple.
            The ethics of cryptocurrency refers to the moral issues
            and problems that arise from the use of digital currencies.
            Some of the ethical issues surrounding cryptocurrency
            include: Anonymity and Volatility.
            NEW TECHNOLOGIES ETHICS: 
            CRYPTOCURRENCY
            Anonymity is Cryptocurrency allows for anonymous
            transactions, raising concerns about the potential for
            illegal activities such as money laundering and the
            financing of terrorism.
            Example: In 2019, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ)
            announced that it had held nearly $1 billion worth of
            cryptocurrency from the online black market known as
            the "Silk Road." The Silk Road was an online
            marketplace that allowed users to buy and sell illegal
            goods and services using cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin.
            NEW TECHNOLOGIES ETHICS: 
            CRYPTOCURRENCY
            Volatility is Cryptocurrency is known for its high
            instability, raising concerns about the potential for
            investment losses and the stability of the financial system.
            Example: In 2021,the flagship cryptocurrency fell to more
            than three-month lows, dropping to about $30,000 at one
            point.

            INTERNET OF THINGS 
            10) Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the network
            of physical objects, such as devices, vehicles,
            buildings, and other items embedded with
            electronics, software, sensors, and connectivity,
            which enables these objects to collect and
            exchange data.
            NEW TECHNOLOGIES ETHICS: 
            INTERNET OF THINGS 
            IoT devices collect and transmit large amounts of
            personal data, which raises concerns about the
            potential for data breaches and the misuse of personal
            information.
            Example: In 2018, it was reported that a security flaw
            in a popular brand of internet-connected baby
            monitors allowed hackers to access the cameras and
            microphone, watch and listen to the babies in their
            rooms. This raised concerns about the security and
            privacy of IoT devices and the potential for personal
            data to be misused</p>
